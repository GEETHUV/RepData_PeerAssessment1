## Loading and preprocessing the data

> activity<-read.csv("activity.csv")

> head(activy)

Error in head(act) : object 'acttivy' not found

> head(activity)

output

  steps       date interval
  
1    NA 2012-10-01        0

2    NA 2012-10-01        5

3    NA 2012-10-01       10

4    NA 2012-10-01       15

5    NA 2012-10-01       20

6    NA 2012-10-01       25

Now we have to remove the NA values from our data. For that

> Clean_activity<-activity[complete.cases(activity),]

> dim(clean_activity)

Error: object 'clean_activity' not found

> dim(Clean_activity)

[1] 15264     3
